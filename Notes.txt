APOCOPE FALSE POS
-517-528 we need an apocope that acts before syncope 1 that somehow doesn't break anything.
-excrescence DOES bleed syncope 1
-DEGEMINATION NEEDS TO COUNTERFEED at least some of the apocope rules. probably the simple apocope at a minimum and maybe even the liquid cluster apocope.

POSTTONIC SYNCOPE
-actually seems like there's some low-ish hanging fruit here:
---seems to need [-lat] in the post-locus segment but maybe only when after secondary stress?
---speaking of which, might just behave differently when after secondary stress

PRETONIC SYNCOPE
-blocked by preceding double consonant



WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT APHERESIS
-128 episcopum/bizbe
-317 illorum/llur
-434 horologium/rellodga?
-523/1212 acripholum/grèbul
-942 umbilicum/melic
-1205 abrotonum/bròide



z-deletion is a problem rule. take notes later

-----also, this rule has to come after hiatus resolution, at least i think...
-----the pre-locus conditioning could be [-cons] (given 396 and 676), but that messes up 3 and 395...



rj>jr holds many mysteries
---probably doesn't happen word-finally?
---i think the [-back] block we have on it now is wrong (hence its removal)



another huge hole: late latin c doesn't go to z every time. we have it accurately going to ʃ when it needs to but it only >z>∅ sometimes.
---semi-related issue: late latin t͡sʲ doesn't always have the same outcomes as late latin c (unless i'm reading it wrong (<--might've been reading it wrong...))



=tempj for resolving accidental ʝ-deletion



WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHY "SYNCOPE 0" IS HELPING. IT SHOULD NOT EXIST
---maybe c>...>s needs to be post-syncope?! (but this breaks things...)
the deletion before /__s# just feels like a missed syncope. fix the syncope
