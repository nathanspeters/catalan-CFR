APOCOPE FALSE POS
-517-528 we need an apocope that acts before syncope 1 that somehow doesn't break anything.
-excrescence DOES bleed syncope 1
-DEGEMINATION NEEDS TO COUNTERFEED at least some of the apocope rules. probably the simple apocope at a minimum and maybe even the liquid cluster apocope.

POSTTONIC SYNCOPE
-actually seems like there's some low-ish hanging fruit here:
---seems to need [-lat] in the post-locus segment but maybe only when after secondary stress?
---speaking of which, might just behave differently when after secondary stress

PRETONIC SYNCOPE
-blocked by preceding double consonant



WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT APHERESIS
-128 episcopum/bizbe
-317 illorum/llur
-523/1212 acripholum/grèbul
-942 umbilicum/melic
-1205 abrotonum/bròide



WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHY "SYNCOPE 0" IS HELPING. IT SHOULD NOT EXIST
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHY THE SECOND r DELETION IS HELPING. IT SHOULD NOT EXIST



STUFF THAT'S FAKE NEWS
-hordeum/ordi is a reborrowing
-persicum/présec is some analogy with pre- i think
