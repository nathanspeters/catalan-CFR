APOCOPE FALSE POS
-517-528 we need an apocope that acts before syncope 1 that somehow doesn't break anything.
-excrescence DOES bleed syncope 1 <--what excrescence?
-DEGEMINATION NEEDS TO COUNTERFEED at least some of the apocope rules. probably the simple apocope at a minimum and maybe even the liquid cluster apocope.
---maybe...prioritize this?
-----doesn't affect accuracy anymore when i do this...

POSTTONIC SYNCOPE
-actually seems like there's some low-ish hanging fruit here:
---seems to need [-lat] in the post-locus segment but maybe only when after secondary stress?
---speaking of which, might just behave differently when after secondary stress
-between nasals needs further examination/clarification
-maybe needs to be blocked before fricatives? EDIT: see below
---ok this needs blocked before all voiced fricatives. (probably not voiceless ones, but keep this in mind for later.) you may notice that it looks like it *should* happen after beta. this is false. these forms are getting got by the *pre*tonic syncope, not the posttonic one. see 742 paraveredum>palafrè.
-------ok so actually the issue appears to be more complicated than this (see forms with ˈVtið)

-----also, this rule has to come after hiatus resolution, at least i think...
-----the pre-locus conditioning could be [-cons] (given 396 and 676), but that messes up 3 and 395...



another huge hole: late latin c doesn't go to z every time. we have it accurately going to ʃ when it needs to but it only >z>∅ sometimes.
---semi-related issue: late latin t͡sʲ doesn't always have the same outcomes as late latin c (unless i'm reading it wrong (<--might've been reading it wrong...))



=tempj for resolving accidental ʝ-deletion



WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHY "SYNCOPE 0" IS HELPING. IT SHOULD NOT EXIST
---maybe c>...>s needs to be post-syncope?! (but this breaks things...) <---RESOLVED!!!!!!!!!!! ...but syncope 0 is still helping.
---problem found: frication is messing up the outcomes. either it needs to come after syncope 1 or we need a new rule that hardens eth before a stop. <---RESOLVED, but with the second option, which i don't really like.

n>0/__s might be too early

the deletion before /__s# just feels like a missed syncope. fix the syncope (also the rule we have there at the moment is bad)



Wheeler (2007) syncopes making things worse. figure out why.
Wheeler also wants intervocalic voicing to precede syncope. This is wrong. Do not give in.
Wheeler also suggests that (some) apocope bleeds syncope. try to implement this later because the evidence presented is convincing
---namely, complex apocopes happen before the posttonic syncopes. simple apocope is bled by posttonic syncope, as we have seen

our nasal dissimilation rules might be too late.



hiatus repair has lots of issues:
-apparently intervocalic ʝ deletion happens before intervocalic z deletion. hiatus repair happens after ʝ deletion but not after z deletion
-----EDIT: hiatus repair is apparently a whole issue. the fix isn't this simple



add r>l/__(anything)*l



need to figure out dʒ vs dz <---LATER it only affects a very small number of etyma (3) we can deal with it at the end
---also, tell max to find more etyma with dz in the output



is t̪izˈoɾəs really the output of t̪ˌon̪sˈoːrias/t̪ˌoːn̪sˈorias/t̪ˌon̪sˈorias? (i mean it probably is but i fail to see how the /i/ got there) $ NO IT IS NOT according to REW

s~w/__# confusion still needs finished. turns out not a whole lot's wrong with it...



ok i really want to work on 'e problems but it looks like I need to figure out the early stress shift:
---appears to have something to do with {[+lo];[-lo,-hi,-tense]} C (W) {[+hi];[-lo,-hi,+tense]}, but other things would need to feed this (namely a couple of /ˌe/s lowering to /ˌɛ/)
-----ok the e lowerings are done but my rules as they stand are MASSIVELY overproductive. will need to look at this further later



NEXT TIME: ***move vowel delengthening***
