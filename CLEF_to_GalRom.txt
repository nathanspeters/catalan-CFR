$From Mildred Katherine Pope's 1934 "From Latin to Modern French"
$We follow exactly the order as stipulated in Chapter II starting on page 72, with some input from other chapters where appropriate
$However, she explains in her elaboration chapters some places where clearly the order is not what it is listed as in Chapter 4,
$ ... so we implement those instead
$ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

$Characteristics of Classical Latin as per Pope page 75
$ CORRECTION: We delete Pope's handling of Classical Latin's variant /l/ forms,
	 $as they do not seem to be diachronically relevant, 
	 	$and harm performance.
n̪ > ŋ / __ [+hi,+back,-cont]
ɡ > ŋ / __ [+nas,+cor]
[+lo] > [-front,+back]
[+lo] > [+front,-back] / __ e̯
{j;w} > [+cons,-son] / __ [+syl] $as per Pope s106 -- Pope considers w and j when not "vocalic" (i.e. part of diphthong) to be fricative
	$ for j, p55 s106c ; for w, p56 s109
$ Note that the sequence u: + w does not seem to occur in Latin 
$ If it did there would be some logical issues with Pope's rules -- i.e. s343 she states "beta from b" is effaced after u: 
	$ where of course w (by which she means gamma^w) had already shifted to beta s186 much earlier 
	$ -- of course sound change has no memory! However this issue is moot because u:+w doesn't occur in Latin it seems
	
$ CORRECTION : Pope forgets to explicitly say that w is a proper w not ɣʷ after velar consonants hence why we don't end up with tons of kv clusters.
$ To be sure she does note (s186) that "betacism doesn't occur after k" but she doesn't notice that other affects she attributes to ɣʷ are not occurring in the presence
$ of k -- such as the deletion of the rounded "fricative"/approximant before ʝ (indeed after kw, it is the ʝ that is deleted it seems...) 
ɣʷ > w / [+back,+hi,+cons] __

$ beginning of Late Latin shifts here... 
$As per Pope's paradigm, it is considered Late Latin if it occurred before the end of the fifth century
$ we place the marker later as per the FLLAPS table. 

$p144 s359 ~ p73 s156iii --- ns > s, with compensatory lengthening of prior vowel -- must have occurred before nature of length changed
$Pope says "very early" s359
$CORRECTION: now lengthening occurs in the context of non-stressed following syllable,
	$ and the n loss is triggered by being between a specifically long vowel and s.
[+syl] > [+long] / __ n̪ s ([-syl])* [-stres] 
n̪ > ∅ / [+syl,+long] __  s

$p144 s359 ~ p73 s156iii --- rs > s after long vowels, > ss after short vowels
	$must have occurred before nature of length changed
	$ implicitly consecutive vowels are "long" and second becomes so if not-- case of deorsum
$ CORRECTION : we only implement the stipulated shifts occurring 
	$after long vowels and two vowel sequences, and not after two vowel sequences either.
	$ Because the rs > ss shift after single short vowels 
	$ seems to only be correct for two lexemes, persica and dorsum.
$ (CORR cont'd) we also now suppress the part of the rule that occurred after two non-consonantals, no targets as deorsum was attenuated)
[+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > ∅ / [+syl,+long] __ s 
$ [+cor,+son,-nas,-lat] > ∅ / [-cons] [-cons] __ s

$ CORRECTION: stressed i + e > iː x (pietatem type lexemes affected)
	$ needs to bleed any detensing that occurs via Pope s154i
	$ may have appearance of overfitting but Pope explicitly notes case of pitie' as pixt- thus implying this (in BaseCLEFstar too)

$ -- called upon to be this early by p91 s187

$ CORRECTION: uː unstressed becomes sonus medius

$p91 s187iia
$ CORRECTION: This seems to only reliably occur after /ɑ/ and /ɑː/ -- this is a better reason why vivum, ovum and nativum are unaffected than "analogy" (which Pope says in s188).
ɣʷ > ∅ / [+lo] __ [+syl,+round]

$ as per s186iib -- w effaced between k and a rounded vowel

w > ∅ / k __ [+syl,+round]

$ p115 s261-264 ~ s221 ~ s156i
$ *** Note as per s156i, for Pope this is a "tendency" 
$ the slurring ... of "proparoxytones" ... i.e. where the tonic syllable was followed by two unstressed sylls before hte word coda
$ ... typically concerning those which are common suffixes here.
$ Pope attests this with the Appendix Probi, which was written in the third or fourth centuries but does not say that is when it specifically occurred. 
$ Because of words like "table", we know it probably occurred before lenition of intervocalic b (early second century) but Pope does not confirm this either. 
$ By placing it here before the beginning of betacism, we are giving Pope the benefit of the doubt. 
$ This is also inline with what she states about the -itus,-itum etc group -- she is holding that this phenomenon occurred before hte beginnings
$ 	of palatalization  (s296)
$ Further note : s262b -- Pope notes that sometimes the older forms were restored by preservative analogy via "clerkly influence" 
$ p115 s262a -- effects on -ulus,-ulum,-ula words. Attested for affecting those where preceding cons is k,g,t,p or b. There don't seem to be
	$ any words of this type ending in -dulus,-dulum, or -dula. 
$ CORRECTION : -mulum endings also effected (cumulum > comble; tremulum > tremble)

$ p115 s262b -- effects on the -idus,-idis,-itis etc group : for prior consonsants Pope lists l, g, t, s, k, and r
	$ the most faithful way to render this also in line with Occam's Razor would seem to be [+cons] 
	$ *** NOTE s353 -- seems to imply it was possible for this to NOT occur for some words
	$ note also the frigidus contradiction: s297 & s316 vs. s262ii & s296i
$ CORRECTION: ɪ does not disappear before t at this point as all the affected words (hospitem, comitem, lenditem, limitem) need to eject ə after final vowels are lost
$ CORRECTION: ɪ only disappears before d[+front,-lo] when after a sonorant (magidem must also eject ə -- so cluster must be formed in Gallo-Roman stage)
$ CORRECTION: ɪ before dʊ does not disappear if previous consonant is voiceless, as these will need to eject ə in Gallo-Roman when final vowels are lost (muccidum, nitidum, sapidum, tepidum)

ɪ > ∅ / ɣʷ __ k

$as per p91 s187i -- ɣʷ > w when preconsonantal due to "slurring"
ɣʷ > w / __ [+cons]

$ CORRECTION: a much more effective and thorough way to describe the 
	$apparent contexts of deconsonantalization of ɣʷ here...
$ actually covering two shifts
$ it appears that this occurred in all ɑɣʷɪ sequences : navicellam, navicam, avicam, avicellam, Pictavis, etc...
$ Pope (s187i) says this is due to "slurring" but she nowhere else described the "slurring" phenomenon that would have fed the rule in this way
$ Doesn't happen when the posterior ɪ is stressed it seems -- see kˌɑwˈɪkulɑm > ʃəvij
$ Hence this is the most efficient way to represent it...: 
$ CORRECTION : abrogated for now as no effect due to correction @ line 175
$ ɣʷ > w / [+lo] __ ɪ 
$ next, to cover the ɑɣʷɑ sequences: bauam, flavam, cavannum. 
$Doesn't seem to happen for -aːre verbs (lava:re)

ɣʷ > w / [+lo] __ [+lo,-long]

$p91 s186: w>beta. Occurred during the 1st and 2nd century ("Nerβa")
$ CORRECTION : as evidenced by Pope s343 causing errors for 10 words that became β from ɣʷ,
$ they did not merge this early, and must have merged AFTER that -- instead we send ɣʷ to βʷ 
$ NOTE: delete and reinsert the <ʷ> to turn off/on the demo
ɣʷ > βʷ

$p73 s155iia and pp136-137 ss332-336 and p6 s9 : b > β intervocalically or between vowel and r (s372)
$According to s336 this occurred very early at least for the bilabial, 2nd century AD 
$Later authors group all voiced stops together for this shift, but Pope is unclear
$She states (s336) that it is attested earlier for b than the others but is unclear
$However she indicates a shift order in s307i that necessitates velar stop palatalization preceding intervocalic lenition
$So we give her the benefit of the doubt and place the lenition of the rest of the velar stops later,
$Right after the beginning of palatalization.
$ she is not clear about whether her j and w ("fricatives") are sonorant, but we will assume they are NOT
	$... given that she called them fricatives -- this is supported by her trajectory for rubeum > rouge (s676)

$ p115 s263 -- with proparoxytons with intervocalic g, both g and preceding vowel deleted "early" (s263)

$ per Pope s185 and s198, combination of vowels that have become adjacent and share the same quality become a single long vowel of same quality

$p73 s155i ~ p91 s185 -- as Pope explained, h-effacement happened word-internally first.

$s505 ~ ˌɑ w > ˌɑ before round stressed sylls -- already handled elsewhere, don't need to redundantly do it here. 

$p73 s154ii : length returns for stressed vowels only, conditioned the open/closed context condition:
$ as per s197-198 -- not "blocked", including word final, followed by vowel, followed by cons + word coda only in a monosyllable,
$ followed by cons + vowel, or followed by plosive + l/r
	$ CORRECTION: before β/v + r + V + # vowels are also lengthened -- chevre, couleuvre, levre, fievre, etc... 
		$ Pope only stipulates that plosive + r is free -- neglecting that b has become fricative here.
			$ (the same does not occur for ðr clusters which are indeed blocked) 
$ note as per p53 s100, note that Pope does not consider glides to be consonants 
	$ but to be fair she specifies  "in hiatus with a following vowel" -- and all her examples feature
		$ hiatus with syllabic vowels, not semivowels
$ -- give her the benefit of the doubt and specify +syl not -cons

$ Unstressed vowels - massive oversimplification [evidenced by the stressed schwa existing in balearic] 
a > ə
e > ə
ɛ > ə
o > u
ɔ > u

$pg 68 the proto catalan [e] became [ə] before the reconquesta of spain. Later in the Valencian territory due to mossarab influence again became [e]. In the wester dialect, the schwa became [ɛ].
