$$$$ NOTES

$VL TONIC VOWELS > CAT (pp64-84)
    $1.1.1 p64: vl ˈi (<ˈi:)
        $Always /ˈi/ (or /j/ when non-nuclear)
    $1.1.2 p65: vl ˈɛ (<ˈe,ˈae):
        $becomes /ˈe/ in cat except when:
            $followed by l
            $followed by rr or r[-lab]
            $followed by nr (ndr) eg. teneru>tendre
            $followed by the /w/ from d or c'eg. pede>peu, dece>deu
            $/i/ when __j (after diphthongization) eg. pects(>?pieits?)>pits
    $1.1.3 p67: vl ˈe (<ˈe:,ˈi,ˈoe)
        $ˈɛ in ECat. Looks like this is from intermediary ˈə which balearic retains.
            $Meyer-lubke: ˈe>ˈə before reconquista
        $p69: vl /ˈe/ -> cat /ˈe/ after /ʒ/ or when followed by /j/, /ɲ/, or /ŋ/. Or betw any 2 palatals
        $p71: vl /ˈe/ -> cat /ˈi/ in certain regular cases 
    $The reversal of the two VL E sounds in tonics is thus ordered:
        $first ˈe>ˈə
        $then ˈɛ>ˈe
        $finally ˈə>ˈɛ in east; ˈə>ˈe in west; unchanged in balearic
    $1.1.4 p73: vl ˈa (<ˈa,ˈa:)
        $generally stays as /ˈa/. F2 quality varies. In certain dialects, is so fronted that it is sometimes transcribed as [ɛ] - not relevant to us.
        $"iod quarta" - /ks/, /kt/, /rj/ /sj/ /pj/ - was the only thing to affect /a/, making it /e/ in mod cat
            $intermediate stage "ei" found in documents <14th c.; some pyrenese dialects still have this.
            $also, there is a metathesis of suffix -ariu(m) > -airu > -eru
            $in french -ariu(m) became -ier, -iere and the -aire is semi-learned
        $ latin au ended up as ɔ; later au (<abu) maintained.
    $1.1.5 p78: vl ˈɔ (<ˈo)
        $generally maintained. There is always a perceptible difference between the two o sounds for catalan speakers.
        $ɔj > uej > uj (im sure we can look at fr cascade for this as well)
        $closed to /o/ when followed by nas+stop cluster eg. monte
        $ɔw has apparently opened to aw 
    $1.1.6 p80: vl ˈo (<ˈo:,ˈu)
        $maintained as /ˈo/ except when:
        $in hiatus - becomes /u/ (I assume nonsyllabic?) eg. duas>dues "two (f.)"
        $followed by nasal+velar or nasal+palatal - becomes /ˈu/ eg. puncta>punta 
        $"iod segona i tercera": closes to /ˈu/ eg. pugnu>puny
        $numerous other cases of closure explained as lexical due to "cultisme" (again)
        $ou > eu change in cruce>creu, voce>veu: timing is debated.
            $this needs some more investigation
    $1.1.7 p84: vl ˈu (<ˈu:)
        $pretty much always kept as ˈu.
        $a few sporadic cases exist where /ˈum/>/ˈom/: pluma>ploma, bruma>broma, flumen>flom

$VL ATONIC VOWELS (pp85-94)
    $First syllable (countertonic)
    $I see a lot of cases in the lexicon where first-syllable a or e are ə in mod cat. Maybe there's something I'm misunderstanding.
        $vl ˌi (<ˌiː)
            $preserved except for when following syllable has i, which triggers still-productive dissim. lowering to e
        $vl ˌa
            $preserved except ˌa[C]j became ˌe
        $ various cases where ˌa or ˌe became ˌi. See section 68 on p85
            $ˌa or ˌe followed by a nasal became ˌi -- singulare>singlar, in directu>indret
            $creare>criar due to hiatus
            $and others
        $ au raises to o (which o?)
        $ vl o > cat o 
            $e.catː realized as /u/ (typical for unstressed u,o,ɔ)
            $rose to /u/ when followed by a palatal sound
            $certain cases of following stressed o change a first-syl o to e
